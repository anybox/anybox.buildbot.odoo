Changes

1.0 (unreleased)
----------------

 - GitHub #1: auto-watch
 - Pluggable system for final cleanups, used for space savings by
   doing the startup cleanups at the end of build : drop database,
   remove dist/build for packaging. The startup ones are good for build
   reliability, the final ones are good to avoid massive amounts of sleeping
   data but can sometimes not be run (master or worker stop etc)
 - GitHub #8: transversal buildslave priority
 - launchpad #1391227: introduced a ``buildout-part`` option in
   MANIFEST, defaulting to the previously hardcoded ``openerp`` value.
   Also introduced options ``start-command`` and ``test-command``
 - launchpad #1388566: dump bootstrap options to a separate file, with
                       format expected by anybox-oe-tarball-deploy
                       (part of anybox-openerp-host package)
 - new dispatching option: by requiring 'postgresql not-used', one
   gets a *unique* build that's not pg version filtered.
 - launchpad #1323234: introduced wkhtmltopdf capability, with display option
 - launchpad #1320321: port reservation and binding for
   ``test-openerp``, and ``openerpcommand-initialize-tests``.
   (requires PhantomJS to actually run).
   Introduction of ``test-odoo`` as an alias (for now) of ``test-openerp``
 - launchpad #1320507: bootstrap script now configurable in standalone
   buildouts
 - new download subfactory: archive from buildmaster (for further packaging
   and test builds)
 - shortcut postgresql distribution of builds with the 'not-used'
   special version filter
 - new pg_remote_copy.timeout option, for the db subfactory
