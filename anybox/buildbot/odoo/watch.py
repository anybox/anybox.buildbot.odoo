    """This class holds information about all VCS repositories to watch

    It supports several VCS systems.

    It works for a set of watched branches, which are read from two sources:

    * the manifest files (usually at ``buildouts/MANIFEST.cfg``) and
    * for those buildouts that have the ``auto-watch`` option set to ``true``,
      (that's the default),
      the per-buildout files at ``watch/<BUILDOUT_NAME>``, which are
      typically uploaded during the builds execution themselves.

    While the latter are not meant for direct human specification, and use a
    direct JSON format, he former are specified through
    the ``watch`` multiline option, with a format that varies according
    to the given VCS. Currently, it looks like::

       watch = bzr URL
               hg PULL-URL BRANCH-NAME
               git PULL-URL BRANCH-NAME

    In all cases, that'll be::

       VCS SOURCE_URL [[BRANCH MINOR SPECS]]

    On top of that, there is support for URL rewriting, through the
    :attr:`url_rewrite_rules` attribute, which must be a list of pairs
    ``(original_prefix, rewritten prefix)``.

    The original URLs are stored in a translation dict for
    quick comparison.
