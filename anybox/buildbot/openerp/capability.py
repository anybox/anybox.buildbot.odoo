    the returned env dict is filled with WithProperties arguments that
    leverage the properties set by some SetCapabilityProperties steps.

    factory is expected to be a BuildFactory with 'build_for' and
    'build_requires' attributes.

    cap2environ is a dict expressing how to derive environment variables from
    capability options. Sample format:

       'cap_name' : dict(version_prop='the_cap_version',
                         environ={'CAPABIN': '%(cap(bin))s/program'})

    With this setup, and a capability named 'cap_name' with an option
    bin=/usr/local/capname/bin for a slave you'd get on that slave
             CAPABIN=/usr/local/capname/bin/program

    This demonstrates in particular how values of the 'environ' subdicts
    are meant for WithProperties, with substitution of cap(<option>) by
    the property that will hold the value of this capability option.
    Apart from that, the full expressivity of the WithProperties class still
    applies.

    During the build slave selection, the 'capability' dict property value
    gets set from the slave definition. The build steps set by this method
    will extract them as regular properties, which are tailored to be used
    by the returned environ dict.

    This is done for all capabilities mentionned for this factory (through
    build-for and build-requires), so that in particular, it should not
    spawn absurd build steps that can't run on the slave and aren't needed.
