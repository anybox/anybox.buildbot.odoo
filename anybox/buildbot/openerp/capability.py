    :param factory: a :class:`BuildFactory` instance with ``build_for`` and
                    ``build_requires`` attributes.

    :param cap2environ: a :class:`dict` expressing how to derive environment
                        variables from capability options. Sample format::

                         'cap_name' : dict(version_prop='the_cap_version',
                                           environ={

                          CAPABIN=/usr/local/capname/bin/prog

    This demonstrates in particular how values of the ``environ`` subdicts
    are meant for :class:`WithProperties`, with substitution of
    ``cap(<option>)`` by
    the property that will hold the value of this capability option.
    Apart from that, the full expressivity of the :class:`WithProperties`
    class still applies.

    During the build slave selection, the ``capability`` dict property value
    gets set from the slave definition. The build steps set by this method
    will extract them as regular properties, which are tailored to be used
    by the returned environ dict.

    This is done for all capabilities mentionned for this factory (through
    build-for and build-requires), so that in particular, it should not
    spawn absurd build steps that can't run on the slave and aren't needed.
