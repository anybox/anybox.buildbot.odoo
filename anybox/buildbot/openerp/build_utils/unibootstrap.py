"""Universal zc.buildout bootstrapper.

Maybe I'll regret saying this, but this script aims to be the ultimate solution
to issues with buildout bootstrap.

Of course it is advisable for a developper to always use the latest version of
zc.buildout and the official bootstrap that ships with it, but that is
impractical for production maintainance use-cases, especially those on
older systems:

- sometimes, a newer version of zc.buildout would not want to work readily in
  the production environmnent or with the targetted versions of all the
  dependencies (including recipes). We have experienced many different corner
  cases accross 4 years.
- sometimes, one needs to restore a corrupted system. It's a relief not to
  add another pile of potential problems.
- deployment tools and continuous integration are dumber than humans; for
  idempotency, they have a tendency to rebootstrap even if that's not strictly
  necessary (case of the one liner patch).
- although it is unwise to have old systems, even those whose job is
  precisely to migrate them ASAP have to live with them at least a short while.

All this piled on together means we'd really like a uniform solution able to
produce a ``buildout`` executable for any version, maybe
by restricting the problem space a bit.
This script works under the following assumptions:

- Run the latest version of this script ; if it is bundled with a project,
  ignore the bundled version.
- We are not under Windows. Also, it is tested currently with CPython only.
- The targetted Python is 2.6, 2.7 or >= 3.2, and the Python running the script
  has the same major version.
- There is a system-wide installation of setuptools (or distribute). More
  precisely, the Python version that runs this script has one (it does not
  have to have anything with the targetted Python, see below).

  This may sound not solving the bootstrap problem, but in practice, the
  targetted production systems and bots often have one, thanks to the
  distribution.

- You have a way to prescribe a precise zc.buildout version (it is strongly
  advised to use the same one that the buildout requires, if any). This is not
  totally mandatory, but in practice, bootstrapping with zc.buildout 2.4.1 with
  a buildout configuration that requires 1.0.0 is really looking for trouble.

  Usually, you'd have a configuration file that where you could read a
  ``versions`` section, or some CI tool would have recorded the version used
  at bootstrap time in a ``bootstrap.ini`` file.

- The buildout configuration is consistent. In particular, if it has
  requirements for setuptools, distribute and zc.buildout, it must be
  compatible with them (usually that means that someone was once able to run
  it)

It has the following other desireable properties:

- If you pass a ``--dists-directory`` option, it will try and use what already
  lies there and avoid downloads.
- It will clean up the ``develop-eggs`` directory, which is a well-known source
  of trouble, if applicable.
- You can require a precise version of setuptools or distribute directly.
  This is handy if it is already in the eggs directory, but in that case you
  must be sure it is the right one for the job.


Why yet another bootstrap
-------------------------

The official bootstrap.py script provided by zc.buildout does already a fairly
good job but is not really designed to handle

* it has an inconsistent interface : there are three different sets of
  command-line options that I know of, depending on version
  (this could be solved by using the most recent all the time, same as we
  recommend of the present script)

* it suffers from the chicken-and-egg problem inherent in bootstraps:
  the python interpreter that's used for the bootstrap will then be used for
  all buildout scripts, whereas the present script paves the way to another
  Python interpreter, and could have actually been written in another language.
  This script has been tested with Python 2.6 and 2.7, and can target
  Python 2 >= 2.6 and Python 3 >= 3.2

* at the time of this writing, the latest official ``bootstrap.py`` is
  consistently able to install all versions of ``zc.buildout`` that are on PyPI
  (from 1.0.0, yes !), but the resulting ``buildout`` executable refers to the
  ``setuptools`` that's been used for that, which is incompatible in some
  cases. This script also works from zc.buildout 1.0.0 onwards (obviously, the
  buildout configuration must really fix many versions in that case)

For maintainers of this script
------------------------------
Please resist the urge to split this script in separate files, yet alone a
distutils/setuptools library. This would add another layer of chicken-and-eggs
problems, and defeat the point.

Style: pep8 or flake8 with ``--ignore=E402``

The code is organized for a clear separation between two concerns:

* finding which versions of ``zc.buildout``, and most importantly
  ``setuptools`` to use if not specified explicitely on the command line.
  This is done by :py:func:``guess_versions`, in which it should be
  rather easy to add new rules. It is put right at the beginning of the file,
  before the imports, to underscore that separation, and we believe this
  exception to PEP8 to be justified.
* providing the needed versions and running stage 2 of
  bootstrap (equivalent of the ``boostsrap`` command of the ``buildout``)
  executable.

  There are dirty hacks for corner case, we tried to enclose them as much
  as possible in abstractions for later improvements.

Current bugs
------------
* Python3 support is generally experimental and not so well tested than
  the Python2 case.
* Python3 + distribute: we don't know  how to find an appropriate setuptools
  version to start with. Workaround: make a virtualenv without distribute.
