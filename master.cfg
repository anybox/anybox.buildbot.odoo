# The 'builders' list defines the Builders, which tell Buildbot how
# to perform a build, what steps, and which slaves can execute them.

# listing and description of buildouts to run in a manifest file

# it is therefore recommended to make different builders for significant
# environment differences (e.g., postgresql version). Our utilities will
# make that automatic.
