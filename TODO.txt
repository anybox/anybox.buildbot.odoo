* EASY: automatically run buildouts with slave-level ``eggs-directory`` and
  ``openerp-downloads-directory``. That'd solve concurrency issues
  between different slaves.

* have the slaves retrieve ``build_utils`` directly from VCS. This
  will probably complicate the scheduling setup.

* EASY: use (also) test log analyzer and test launching commands from
  openerp-runbot.

* HARD: authenticate buildslave PG role over unix domain sockets
  (last time I looked, openerp did not honor the PGCLUSTER environment
  variable).
