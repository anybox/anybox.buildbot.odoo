* HARD (lots of boring work): provide unit tests

* EASY: use (also) test log analyzer and test launching commands from
  openerp-runbot.

* MEDIUM: add a build property for human readability of branches being
  tested. Ideally, do that on the Change object if that works.

* HARD: true reproduceability and better blame list through setting of
  revs in build properties together with new options in buildout
  recipe to apply them. NB: it seems that property values can be dicts
