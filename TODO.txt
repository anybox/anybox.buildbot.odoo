Required for actual use
-----------------------

* Scheduler to watch VCS systems according to conf in buildouts
  MANIFEST or maybe the buildout themselves (check if openerp-runbot
  does indeed launchpad polling).


Later improvements
------------------

* EASY: automatically run buildouts with slave-level ``eggs-directory`` and
  ``openerp-downloads-directory``. That'd solve concurrency issues
  between different slaves.

* MEDIUM: provide options in MANIFEST.cfg to limit buildouts to some
  PG versions, to ease the load due to useless cases (known
  incompatibilites don't have to be tried over and over; some PG
  versions may be of interest in a few cases only). We need a global
  setting, and per-buildout settings.

* have the slaves retrieve ``build_utils`` directly from VCS. This
  will probably complicate the scheduling setup.

* EASY: use (also) test log analyzer and test launching commands from
  openerp-runbot.

* HARD: authenticate buildslave PG role over unix domain sockets
  (last time I looked, openerp did not honor the PGCLUSTER environment
  variable).
