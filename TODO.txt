* EASY/NOW: reduce the setup to one import & call, so that buildbot's
  master.cfg don't really have to be linked/copied any more and can
  really differ in password, ports, custom builds etc.

* HARD (lots of boring work): provide unit tests

* MEDIUM: provide options in MANIFEST.cfg to limit buildouts to some
  PG versions, to ease the load due to useless cases (known
  incompatibilites don't have to be tried over and over; some PG
  versions may be of interest in a few cases only). We need a global
  setting, and per-buildout settings.

* MEDIUM: have the slaves retrieve ``build_utils`` directly from VCS. This
  will probably complicate the scheduling setup.

* EASY: use (also) test log analyzer and test launching commands from
  openerp-runbot.

* EASY (special case of new slave parameter for pg_host):
  authenticate buildslave PG role over unix domain sockets (ident)
  PGCLUSTER seems to be Debian specific. The proper way to initiate
  unix domain sockets is to indicate the directory in host parameter *and the
  proper port* (naming of the socket is derived from the port). Tested
  in OpenERP.

* MEDIUM: allow the mirrors to be outside of the master (will help
  with bandwith and sharing between several masters)

* MEDIUM: add a build property for human readability of branches being
  tested. Ideally, do that on the Change object if that works.

* MEDIUM/HARD (lots of work): change conf (slaves.cfg) so that one
  slave per host is enough. Will spare lots of disk and bw thanks to sharing of
  branches, eggs and downloads at slave level, and work for slave
  admins, too.

* EASY: make setup.py install work. Publish on Pypi ?

* HARD: true reproduceability and better blame list through setting of
  revs in build properties together with new options in buildout
  recipe to apply them.
