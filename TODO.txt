* HARD (lots of boring work): provide unit tests

* MEDIUM: provide options in MANIFEST.cfg to limit buildouts to some
  PG versions, to ease the load due to useless cases (known
  incompatibilites don't have to be tried over and over; some PG
  versions may be of interest in a few cases only). We need a global
  setting, and per-buildout settings.

* MEDIUM: harmonize psql calls: stop using Debian-specific PGCLUSTER,
  allow setting of psql executable (has the correct default for
  unix-socket domains). Use PGHOST environment var with empty value to
  solve the problem of uniformizing defaults for Unix-socket domains,
  instead of passing a host.

* MEDIUM: have the slaves retrieve ``build_utils`` directly from VCS. This
  will probably complicate the scheduling setup.

* EASY: use (also) test log analyzer and test launching commands from
  openerp-runbot.

* MEDIUM: add a build property for human readability of branches being
  tested. Ideally, do that on the Change object if that works.

* HARD: true reproduceability and better blame list through setting of
  revs in build properties together with new options in buildout
  recipe to apply them. NB: it seems that property values can be dicts
