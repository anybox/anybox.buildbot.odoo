Required for actual use
-----------------------

* Scheduler to watch VCS systems according to conf in buildouts
  MANIFEST or maybe the buildout themselves (check if openerp-runbot
  does indeed launchpad polling).


Later improvements
------------------

* MEDIUM: provide options in MANIFEST.cfg to limit buildouts to some
  PG versions, to ease the load due to useless cases (known
  incompatibilites don't have to be tried over and over; some PG
  versions may be of interest in a few cases only). We need a global
  setting, and per-buildout settings.

* have the slaves retrieve ``build_utils`` directly from VCS. This
  will probably complicate the scheduling setup.

* EASY: use (also) test log analyzer and test launching commands from
  openerp-runbot.

* MEDIUM: authenticate buildslave PG role over unix domain sockets
  (last time I looked, openerp did not honor the PGCLUSTER environment
  variable). PGCLUSTER seems to be Debian specific. The proper way to initiate
  unix domain sockets is to indicate the directory in host parameter *and the
  proper port* (naming of the socket is derived from the port). Tested w/
  psycopg2, not yet in OpenERP context
