For contributors
================

.. note:: this project is currently in the process of being renamed to

Code hosting and issue tracker
------------------------------

 * Code repository and bug tracker:
   https://github.com/anybox.buildbot.odoo
 * PyPI page: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/anybox.buildbot.openerp

Please use GitHub to report any bug or ask for a new feature.

Coding style and unit tests
---------------------------

We're using ``flake8`` and ``nose`` in exactly the same way as `in the
buildout recipe
<http://docs.anybox.fr/anybox.recipe.odoo/current/contributing.html#coding-style>`_,
including the ``test-cover`` convenience.


Continuous integration
----------------------

`Anybox's public buildbot
<https://buildbot.anybox.fr/builders/anybox.buildbot.openerp>`_ runs
the tests and builds this documentation.
